I am instructed by the course coordinator Dr. Pradip K Das to inform you all to upload your assignments of "k-means" as complete zipped file containing complete visual studio project.
1. The expected outputs are the codebook & a graph showing the distortion vs no. of iterations.
2. Log file should contain the various intermediate outputs like the no. of vectors that are allotted to each cluster as you go through the k-means algorithm. Also the distortion for the current codebook at that time.
3. PFA Universe.csv
Note:
1.The deadline for submission is 06:00 pm Saturday, September 12th 2014.
2. Create a "Configuration.txt" to store all configurations details/ constants required for program. You should read configurations from this file only.
Mandatory entry includes
i. Frame Size:
3. Create "Readme.txt" and write following details in it
i. Roll No:
ii. Name:
iii. Assignment: 5 K-means.
iv. Visual Studio version:
v. Steps to execute your code
4. The assignment should be submitted by 06.00pm, 12/09/2015, Saturday.
5. Upload link: https://172.16.117.149/CS566_uploader/
6. If you have any queries, immediately post here.
